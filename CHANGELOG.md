### Breaking changes
- Removed deprecated `--json` parameter, use global parameter `--output=json` instead

  For those still using the old paths (`$HOME/.config/signal`, `$HOME/.config/textsecure`) you need to move those to the new location.

- Support for reading data from remote Signal storage. Now v2 groups will be shown after linking a new device.
- New `submitRateLimitChallenge` command that can be used to lift some rate-limits by solving a captcha
