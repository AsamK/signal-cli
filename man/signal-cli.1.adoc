== Name

signal-cli - A commandline interface for the Signal messenger

== Synopsis

*signal-cli* [--config CONFIG] [-h | -v | -a ACCOUNT | --dbus | --dbus-system] command [command-options]

== Description

signal-cli is a commandline interface for libsignal-service-java.
It supports registering, verifying, sending and receiving messages.
For registering you need a phone number where you can receive SMS or incoming calls.
signal-cli was primarily developed to be used on servers to notify admins of important events.
For this use-case, it has a dbus and a JSON-RPC interface, that can be used to send messages from other programs.

For some functionality the Signal protocol requires that all messages have been received from the server.
The `receive` command should be regularly executed.
In daemon mode messages are continuously received.

== Options

*-h*, *--help*::
Show help message and quit.

*--version*::
Print the version and quit.

*-v*, *--verbose*::
Raise log level and include lib signal logs.

*--log-file* LOG_FILE::
Write log output to the given file.
If `--verbose` is also given, the detailed logs will only be written to the log file.

*--scrub-log*::
Scrub possibly sensitive information from the log, like phone numbers and UUIDs.

*--config* CONFIG::
Set the path, where to store the config.
Make sure you have full read/write access to the given directory.
(Default: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/signal-cli` (`$HOME/.local/share/signal-cli`))

*-a* ACCOUNT, *--account* ACCOUNT::
Specify your phone number, that will be your identifier.
The phone number must include the country calling code, i.e. the number must start with a "+" sign.

This flag must not be given for the `link` command.
It is optional for the `daemon` command.
For all other commands it is only optional if there is exactly one local user in the config directory.

*--service-environment* ENVIRONMENT::
Choose the server environment to use:

- `live` (default)
- `staging`

*--dbus*::
Make request via user dbus.

*--dbus-system*::
Make request via system dbus.

*-o* OUTPUT-MODE, *--output* OUTPUT-MODE::
Specify if you want commands to output in either "plain-text" mode or in "json".
Defaults to "plain-text"

*--trust-new-identities* TRUST-MODE::
Choose when to trust new identities:
- `on-first-use` (default): Trust the first seen identity key from new users, changed keys must be verified manually
- `always`: Trust any new identity key without verification
- `never`: Don't trust any unknown identity key, every key must be verified manually

*--disable-send-log*::
Disable message send log (for resending messages that recipient couldn't decrypt).

== Commands

=== register

Register a phone number with SMS or voice verification.
Use the verify command to complete the verification.

If the account is just deactivated, the register command will just reactivate account, without requiring an SMS verification.
By default the unregister command just deactivates the account, in which case it can be reactivated without sms verification if the local data is still available.
If the account was deleted (with --delete-account) it cannot be reactivated.

*-v*, *--voice*::
The verification should be done over voice, not SMS.

*--captcha*::
The captcha token, required if registration failed with a captcha required error.
To get the token, go to https://signalcaptchas.org/registration/generate.html
For the staging environment, use: https://signalcaptchas.org/staging/registration/generate.html
Check the developer tools for a redirect starting with signalcaptcha:// Everything after signalcaptcha:// is the captcha token.

=== verify

Verify the number using the code received via SMS or voice.

VERIFICATIONCODE::
The verification code.

*-p* PIN, *--pin* PIN::
The registration lock PIN, that was set by the user.
Only required if a PIN was set.

=== unregister

Disable push support for this device, i.e. this device won't receive any more messages.
If this is the primary device, other users can't send messages to this number anymore.
Use "updateAccount" to undo this.
To remove a linked device, use "removeDevice" from the primary device.

*--delete-account*::
Delete account completely from server.
Cannot be undone without loss.
You will have to be readded to each group.

CAUTION: Only delete your account if you won't use this number again!

=== deleteLocalAccountData

Delete all local data for this account.
Data should only be deleted if the account is unregistered.

CAUTION: This cannot be undone.

*--ignore-registered*::
Delete the account data even though the account is still registered on the Signal servers.

=== updateAccount

Update the account attributes on the signal server.
Can fix problems with receiving messages.

*-n* NAME, *--device-name* NAME::
Set a new device name for the primary or linked device

=== updateConfiguration

Update signal configs and sync them to linked devices.
This command only works on the primary devices.

*--read-receipts* {true,false}::

REGISTRATION_LOCK_PIN::
The registration lock PIN, that will be required for new registrations (resets after 7 days of inactivity)

=== removePin

Remove the registration lock pin.

=== link

Link to an existing device, instead of registering a new number.
This shows a "sgnl://linkdevice?uuid=..." URI.
If you want to connect to another signal-cli instance, you can just use this URI.
If you want to link to an Android/iOS device, create a QR code with the URI (e.g. with qrencode) and scan that in the Signal app.

*-n* NAME, *--name* NAME::
Optionally specify a name to describe this new device.
By default "cli" will be used.

=== addDevice
