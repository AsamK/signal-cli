== Name

signal-cli - A commandline and dbus interface for the Signal messenger

== Synopsis

*signal-cli* [--config CONFIG] [-h | -v | -u USERNAME | --dbus | --dbus-system] command [command-options]

== Description

signal-cli is a commandline interface for libsignal-service-java.
It supports registering, verifying, sending and receiving messages.
For registering you need a phone number where you can receive SMS or incoming calls.
signal-cli was primarily developed to be used on servers to notify admins of important events.
For this use-case, it has a dbus interface, that can be used to send messages from any programming language that has dbus bindings.

For some functionality the Signal protocol requires that all messages have been received from the server.
The `receive` command should be regularly executed. In daemon mode messages are continuously received.

== Options

*-h*, *--help*::
Show help message and quit.

*-v*, *--version*::
Print the version and quit.

*--verbose*::
Raise log level and include lib signal logs.

*--config* CONFIG::
Set the path, where to store the config.
Make sure you have full read/write access to the given directory.
(Default: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/signal-cli` (`$HOME/.local/share/signal-cli`))

*-u* USERNAME, *--username* USERNAME::
Specify your phone number, that will be your identifier.
The phone number must include the country calling code, i.e. the number must start with a "+" sign.

This flag must not be given for the `link` command.
It is optional for the `daemon` command.
For all other commands it is only optional if there is exactly one local user in the
config directory.

*--dbus*::
Make request via user dbus.

*--dbus-system*::
Make request via system dbus.

*-o* OUTPUT-MODE, *--output* OUTPUT-MODE::
Specify if you want commands to output in either "plain-text" mode or in "json". Defaults to "plain-text"

== Commands

=== register

Register a phone number with SMS or voice verification.
Use the verify command to complete the verification.

*-v*, *--voice*::
The verification should be done over voice, not SMS.

*--captcha*::
The captcha token, required if registration failed with a captcha required error.
To get the token, go to https://signalcaptchas.org/registration/generate.html
Check the developer tools for a redirect starting with signalcaptcha://
Everything after signalcaptcha:// is the captcha token.

=== verify

Verify the number using the code received via SMS or voice.

VERIFICATIONCODE::
The verification code.

*-p* PIN, *--pin* PIN::
The registration lock PIN, that was set by the user.
Only required if a PIN was set.

=== unregister

Disable push support for this device, i.e. this device won't receive any more messages.

Use "updateAccount" to undo this.
To remove a linked device, use "removeDevice" from the master device.

=== updateAccount

=== link

Link to an existing device, instead of registering a new number.
This shows a "tsdevice:/…" URI. If you want to connect to another signal-cli instance, you can just use this URI.
If you want to link to an Android/iOS device, create a QR code with the URI (e.g. with qrencode) and scan that in the Signal app.

By default "cli" will be used.

=== addDevice

Link another device to this device.

objects under the same bus name.

*--system*::
Use DBus system bus instead of user bus.
*--ignore-attachments*::
Don’t download attachments of received messages.

== Examples

Register a number (with SMS verification)::
signal-cli -u USERNAME register

Verify the number using the code received via SMS or voice::
signal-cli -u USERNAME verify CODE

Send a message to one or more recipients::
signal-cli -u USERNAME send -m "This is a message" [RECIPIENT [RECIPIENT ...]] [-a [ATTACHMENT [ATTACHMENT ...]]]

Pipe the message content from another process::
uname -a | signal-cli -u USERNAME send [RECIPIENT [RECIPIENT ...]]

Create a group::
signal-cli -u USERNAME updateGroup -n "Group name" -m [MEMBER [MEMBER ...]]

Add member to a group::
signal-cli -u USERNAME updateGroup -g GROUP_ID -m "NEW_MEMBER"

Leave a group::
signal-cli -u USERNAME quitGroup -g GROUP_ID

Send a message to a group::
signal-cli -u USERNAME send -m "This is a message" -g GROUP_ID

Trust new key, after having verified it::
signal-cli -u USERNAME trust -v SAFETY_NUMBER NUMBER

Trust new key, without having verified it. Only use this if you don't care about security::
signal-cli -u USERNAME trust -a NUMBER

== Exit codes
* *1*: Error is probably caused and fixable by the user
* *2*: Some unexpected error
* *3*: Server or IO error
* *4*: Sending failed due to untrusted key

== Files

The password and cryptographic keys are created when registering and stored in the current users home directory, the directory can be changed with *--config*:

`$XDG_DATA_HOME/signal-cli/` (`$HOME/.local/share/signal-cli/`)

For legacy users, the old config directories are used as a fallback:

    $HOME/.config/signal/

    $HOME/.config/textsecure/
