Name
----
signal-cli - A commandline and dbus interface for the Signal messenger

Synopsis
--------
*signal-cli* [--config CONFIG] [-h | -v | -u USERNAME | --dbus | --dbus-system] command [command-options]

Description
-----------

signal-cli is a commandline interface for libsignal-service-java. It supports
registering, verifying, sending and receiving messages. For registering you need a
phone number where you can receive SMS or incoming calls.
signal-cli was primarily developed to be used on servers to notify admins of
important events. For this use-case, it has a dbus interface, that can be used to
send messages from any programming language that has dbus bindings.

Options
-------

*-h*, *--help*::
	Show help message and quit.

*-v*, *--version*::
	Print the version and quit.

*--config* CONFIG::
	Set the path, where to store the config.
	Make sure you have full read/write access to the given directory.
	(Default: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/signal-cli` (`$HOME/.local/share/signal-cli`))

*-u* USERNAME, *--username* USERNAME::
	Specify your phone number, that will be your identifier.
	The phone number must include the country calling code, i.e. the number must
	start with a "+" sign.

*--dbus*::
	Make request via user dbus.

*--dbus-system*::
	Make request via system dbus.

Commands
--------

register
~~~~~~~~
Register a phone number with SMS or voice verification. Use the verify command to
complete the verification.

*-v*, *--voice*::
	The verification should be done over voice, not SMS.

verify
~~~~~~
Verify the number using the code received via SMS or voice.

VERIFICATIONCODE::
	The verification code.

*-p* PIN, *--pin* PIN::
	The registration lock PIN, that was set by the user. Only required if a PIN was set.

unregister
~~~~~~~~~~
Disable push support for this device, i.e. this device won't receive any more messages.
If this is the master device, other users can't send messages to this number anymore.
Use "updateAccount" to undo this.
To remove a linked device, use "removeDevice" from the master device.

updateAccount
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Update the account attributes on the signal server.
Can fix problems with receiving messages.

setPin
~~~~~~
Set a registration lock pin, to prevent others from registering this number.

REGISTRATION_LOCK_PIN::
    The registration lock PIN, that will be required for new registrations (resets after 7 days of inactivity)

removePin
~~~~~~~~~
Remove the registration lock pin.

link
~~~~
Link to an existing device, instead of registering a new number.  This shows a
"tsdevice:/…" URI. If you want to connect to another signal-cli instance, you can
just use this URI. If you want to link to an Android/iOS device, create a QR code
with the URI (e.g. with qrencode) and scan that in the Signal app.

*-n* NAME, *--name* NAME::
	Optionally specify a name to describe this new device. By default "cli" will
	be used.

addDevice
~~~~~~~~~
Link another device to this device. Only works, if this is the master device.

*--uri* URI::
	Specify the uri contained in the QR code shown by the new device.                                                            

listDevices
~~~~~~~~~~~
Show a list of connected devices.

removeDevice
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Remove a connected device. Only works, if this is the master device.

*-d* DEVICEID, *--deviceId* DEVICEID::
	Specify the device you want to remove. Use listDevices to see the deviceIds.

send
~~~~
Send a message to another user or group.

RECIPIENT::
	Specify the recipients’ phone number.

*-g* GROUP, *--group* GROUP::
	Specify the recipient group ID in base64 encoding.

*-m* MESSAGE, *--message* MESSAGE::
	Specify the message, if missing, standard input is used.

*-a* [ATTACHMENT [ATTACHMENT ...]], *--attachment* [ATTACHMENT [ATTACHMENT ...]]::
	Add one or more files as attachment.

*-e*, *--endsession*::
	Clear session state and send end session message.

receive
~~~~~~~
Query the server for new messages. New messages are printed on standardoutput and
attachments are downloaded to the config directory.

*-t* TIMEOUT, *--timeout* TIMEOUT::
	Number of seconds to wait for new messages (negative values disable timeout).
	Default is 5 seconds.
*--ignore-attachments*::
	Don’t download attachments of received messages.
*--json*::
	Output received messages in json format, one object per line.

updateGroup
~~~~~~~~~~~
Create or update a group.

*-g* GROUP, *--group* GROUP::
	Specify the recipient group ID in base64 encoding. If not specified, a new
	group with a new random ID is generated.

*-n* NAME, *--name* NAME::
	Specify the new group name.

*-a* AVATAR, *--avatar* AVATAR::
	Specify a new group avatar image file.

*-m* [MEMBER [MEMBER ...]], *--member* [MEMBER [MEMBER ...]]::
	Specify one or more members to add to the group.

quitGroup

List all known identity keys and their trust status, fingerprint and safety
number.

*-n* NUMBER, *--number* NUMBER::
	Only show identity keys for the given phone number.

trust
~~~~~
Set the trust level of a given number. The first time a key for a number is seen,
it is trusted by default (TOFU). If the key changes, the new key must be trusted
manually.

number::
	Specify the phone number, for which to set the trust.

*-a*, *--trust-all-known-keys*::
	Trust all known keys of this user, only use this for testing.

daemon
~~~~~~
signal-cli can run in daemon mode and provides an experimental dbus interface. For
dbus support you need jni/unix-java.so installed on your system (Debian:
libunixsocket-java ArchLinux: libmatthew-unix-java (AUR)).

*--system*::
	Use DBus system bus instead of user bus.
*--ignore-attachments*::
	Don’t download attachments of received messages.


Examples
--------

Register a number (with SMS verification)::
    signal-cli -u USERNAME register

Verify the number using the code received via SMS or voice::
    signal-cli -u USERNAME verify CODE

Send a message to one or more recipients::
    signal-cli -u USERNAME send -m "This is a message" [RECIPIENT [RECIPIENT ...]] [-a [ATTACHMENT [ATTACHMENT ...]]]

Pipe the message content from another process::
    uname -a | signal-cli -u USERNAME send [RECIPIENT [RECIPIENT ...]]

Create a group::
	signal-cli -u USERNAME updateGroup -n "Group name" -m [MEMBER [MEMBER ...]]

Add member to a group::
	signal-cli -u USERNAME updateGroup -g GROUP_ID -m "NEW_MEMBER"

Leave a group::
	signal-cli -u USERNAME quitGroup -g GROUP_ID

Send a message to a group::
	signal-cli -u USERNAME send -m "This is a message" -g GROUP_ID

Trust new key, after having verified it::
    signal-cli -u USERNAME trust -v FINGER_PRINT NUMBER

Trust new key, without having verified it. Only use this if you don't care about security::
    signal-cli -u USERNAME trust -a NUMBER

Files
-----
The password and cryptographic keys are created when registering and stored in the
current users home directory, the directory can be changed with *--config*:

`$XDG_DATA_HOME/signal-cli/` (`$HOME/.local/share/signal-cli/`)

For legacy users, the old config directories are used as a fallback:

    $HOME/.config/signal/

    $HOME/.config/textsecure/
