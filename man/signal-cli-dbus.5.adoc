== Name

DBus API for signal-cli - A commandline and dbus interface for the Signal messenger

== Synopsis

*signal-cli* [--verbose] [--config CONFIG] [-u USERNAME] [-o {plain-text,json}] daemon [--system]

*dbus-send* [--system | --session] [--print-reply] --type=method_call --dest="org.asamk.Signal" /org/asamk/Signal[/_<phonenum>] org.asamk.Signal.<method> [string:<string argument>] [array:<type>:<array argument>]

Note: when daemon was started without explicit `-u USERNAME`, the `dbus-send` command requires adding the phone number in `/org/asamk/Signal/_<phonenum>`.

== Description

See signal-cli (1) for details on the application.

This documentation handles the supported methods when running signal-cli as a DBus daemon.

The method are described as follows:

method(arg1<type>, arg2<type>, ...) -> return<type>

Where <type> is according to DBus specification:

* <a>   : Array of ... (comma-separated list) (array:)
* (...) : Struct (cannot be sent via `dbus-send`)
* <b>   : Boolean (false|true) (boolean:)
* <i>   : Signed 32-bit (int) integer (int32:)
* <o>   : DBusPath object (objpath:)
* <s>   : String (string:)
* <x>   : Signed 64-bit (long) integer (int64:)
* <y>   : Unsigned 8-bit (byte) integer (byte:)
* <>    : no return value

The final parenthetical value (such as "boolean:") is the type indicator used by `dbus-send`.

Exceptions are the names of the Java Exceptions returned in the body field. They typically contain an additional message with details. All Exceptions begin with "org.asamk.Signal.Error." which is omitted here for better readability.

Phone numbers always have the format +<countrycode><regional number>

== Methods

=== Control methods
These methods are available if the daemon is started anonymously (without an explicit `-u USERNAME`).
Requests are sent to `/org/asamk/Signal`; requests related to individual accounts are sent to
`/org/asamk/Signal/_441234567890` where the + dialing code is replaced by an underscore (_).
Only `version()` is activated in single-user mode; the rest are disabled.

link() -> deviceLinkUri<s>::
link(newDeviceName<s>) -> deviceLinkUri<s>::
* newDeviceName : Name to give new device (defaults to "cli" if no name is given)
* deviceLinkUri : URI of newly linked device

Returns a URI of the form "sgnl://linkdevice/?uuid=...". This can be piped to a QR encoder to create a display that
can be captured by a Signal smartphone client. For example:

`dbus-send --session --dest=org.asamk.Signal --type=method_call --print-reply /org/asamk/Signal org.asamk.Signal.link string:"My secondary client"|tr '\n' '\0'|sed 's/.*string //g'|sed 's/\"//g'|qrencode -s10 -tANSI256`

Exceptions: Failure

listAccounts() -> accountList<as>::
* accountList : Array of all attached accounts in DBus object path form

Exceptions: None

register(number<s>, voiceVerification<b>) -> <>::
* number            : Phone number
* voiceVerification : true = use voice verification; false = use SMS verification

Exceptions: Failure, InvalidNumber, RequiresCaptcha

registerWithCaptcha(number<s>, voiceVerification<b>, captcha<s>) -> <>::
* number            : Phone number
* voiceVerification : true = use voice verification; false = use SMS verification
* captcha           : Captcha string

Exceptions: Failure, InvalidNumber, RequiresCaptcha

verify(number<s>, verificationCode<s>) -> <>::
* number            : Phone number
* verificationCode  : Code received from Signal after successful registration request

Command fails if PIN was set after previous registration; use verifyWithPin instead.

Exceptions: Failure, InvalidNumber

verifyWithPin(number<s>, verificationCode<s>, pin<s>) -> <>::
* number            : Phone number
* verificationCode  : Code received from Signal after successful registration request
* pin               : PIN you set with setPin command after verifying previous registration

Exceptions: Failure, InvalidNumber

version() -> version<s>::
* version : Version string of signal-cli

Exceptions: None

=== Group control methods
The following methods listen to the recipient's object path, which is constructed as follows:
"/org/asamk/Signal/" + DBusNumber
* DBusNumber  : recipient's phone number, with underscore (_) replacing plus (+)

createGroup(groupName<s>, members<as>, avatar<s>) -> groupId<ay>::
* groupName : String representing the display name of the group
* members   : String array of new members to be invited to group

Exceptions: AttachmentInvalid, Failure, InvalidNumber;

* groupId    : Byte array representing the internal group identifier
* objectPath : DBusPath for the group

getGroupMembers(groupId<ay>) -> members<as>::
* groupId   : Byte array representing the internal group identifier
* members   : String array with the phone numbers of all active members of a group

Exceptions: None, if the group name is not found an empty array is returned

joinGroup(inviteURI<s>) -> <>::
* inviteURI : String starting with https://signal.group/#

Behavior of this method depends on the `requirePermission` parameter of the `enableLink` method. If permission is required, `joinGroup` adds you to the requesting members list. Permission may be granted based on the group's `PermissionAddMember` property (`ONLY_ADMINS` or `EVERY_MEMBER`). If permission is not required, `joinGroup` admits you immediately to the group.

Exceptions: Failure

listGroups() -> groups<a(oays)>::
* groups          : Array of Structs(objectPath, groupId, groupName)
** objectPath      : DBusPath
