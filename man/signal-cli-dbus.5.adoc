== Name

DBus API for signal-cli - A commandline and dbus interface for the Signal messenger

== Synopsis

*signal-cli* [--verbose] [--config CONFIG] [-u USERNAME] [-o {plain-text,json}] daemon [--system]

*dbus-send* [--system | --session] [--print-reply] --type=method_call --dest="org.asamk.Signal" /org/asamk/Signal[/_<phonenum>] org.asamk.Signal.<method> [string:<string argument>] [array:<type>:<array argument>]

Note: when daemon was started without explicit `-u USERNAME`, the `dbus-send` command requires adding the phone number in `/org/asamk/Signal/_<phonenum>`.

== Description

See signal-cli (1) for details on the application.

This documentation handles the supported methods when running signal-cli as a DBus daemon.

The method are described as follows:

method(arg1<type>, arg2<type>, ...) -> return<type>

Where <type> is according to DBus specification:

* <s>   : String
* <ay>  : Byte Array
* <aay> : Array of Byte Arrays
* <as>  : String Array
* <ax>  : Array of signed 64 bit integer
* <b>   : Boolean (0|1)
* <x>   : Signed 64 bit integer
* <>    : no return value

Exceptions are the names of the Java Exceptions returned in the body field. They typically contain an additional message with details. All Exceptions begin with "org.asamk.Signal.Error." which is omitted here for better readability.

Phone numbers always have the format +<countrycode><regional number>

== Methods

=== Control methods
These methods are available if the daemon is started anonymously (without an explicit `-u USERNAME`). 
Requests are sent to `/org/asamk/Signal`; requests related to individual accounts are sent to 
`/org/asamk/Signal/_441234567890` where the + dialing code is replaced by an underscore (_). 
Only `version()` is activated in single-user mode; the rest are disabled.

link() -> deviceLinkUri<s>::
link(newDeviceName<s>) -> deviceLinkUri<s>::
* newDeviceName : Name to give new device (defaults to "cli" if no name is given)
* deviceLinkUri : URI of newly linked device

Returns a URI of the form "tsdevice:/?uuid=...". This can be piped to a QR encoder to create a display that
can be captured by a Signal smartphone client. For example:

`dbus-send --session --dest=org.asamk.Signal --type=method_call --print-reply /org/asamk/Signal org.asamk.Signal.link string:"My secondary client"|tr '\n' '\0'|sed 's/.*string //g'|sed 's/\"//g'|qrencode -s10 -tANSI256`

== Signals

SyncMessageReceived (timestamp<x>, sender<s>, destination<s>, groupId<ay>,message<s>, attachments<as>)::
The sync message is received when the user sends a message from a linked device.

ReceiptReceived (timestamp<x>, sender<s>)::
* timestamp : Integer value that can be used to associate this e.g. with a sendMessage()
* sender    : Phone number of the sender

This signal is sent by each recipient (e.g. each group member) after the message was successfully delivered to the device

MessageReceived(timestamp<x>, sender<s>, groupId<ay>, message<s>, attachments<as>)::
* timestamp   : Integer value that is used by the system to send a ReceiptReceived reply
* sender      : Phone number of the sender
* groupId     : Byte array representing the internal group identifier (empty when private message)
* message     : Message text
* attachments : String array of filenames for the attachments. These files are located in the signal-cli storage and the current user needs to have read access there

This signal is received whenever we get a private message or a message is posted in a group we are an active member

== Examples

Send a text message (without attachment) to a contact::
dbus-send --print-reply --type=method_call --dest="org.asamk.Signal" /org/asamk/Signal org.asamk.Signal.sendMessage string:"Message text goes here" array:string: string:+123456789

Send a group message::
dbus-send --session --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=org.asamk.Signal /org/asamk/Signal org.asamk.Signal.sendGroupMessage  string:'The message goes here'  array:string:'/path/to/attachmnt1','/path/to/attachmnt2'  array:byte:139,22,72,247,116,32,170,104,205,164,207,21,248,77,185

Print the group name corresponding to a groupId; the daemon runs on system bus, and was started without an explicit `-u USERNAME`::
dbus-send --system --print-reply --type=method_call --dest='org.asamk.Signal' /org/asamk/Signal/_1234567890 org.asamk.Signal.getGroupName array:byte:139,22,72,247,116,32,170,104,205,164,207,21,248,77,185
