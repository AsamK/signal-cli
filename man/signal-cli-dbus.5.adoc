== Name

DBus API for signal-cli - A commandline and dbus interface for the Signal messenger

== Synopsis

*signal-cli* [--verbose] [--config CONFIG] [-u USERNAME] [-o {plain-text,json}] daemon [--system]

*dbus-send* [--system | --session] [--print-reply] --type=method_call --dest="org.asamk.Signal" /org/asamk/Signal[/_<phonenum>] org.asamk.Signal.<method> [string:<string argument>] [array:<type>:<array argument>]

Note: when daemon was started without explicit `-u USERNAME`, the `dbus-send` command requires adding the phone number in `/org/asamk/Signal/_<phonenum>`.

== Description

See signal-cli (1) for details on the application.

This documentation handles the supported methods when running signal-cli as a DBus daemon.

The method are described as follows:

method(arg1<type>, arg2<type>, ...) -> return<type>

Where <type> is according to DBus specification:

* <s>   : String
* <ay>  : Byte Array
* <aay> : Array of Byte Arrays
* <as>  : String Array
* <b>   : Boolean (0|1)
* <x>   : Signed 64 bit integer
* <>    : no return value

Exceptions are the names of the Java Exceptions returned in the body field. They typically contain an additional message with details. All Exceptions begin with "org.asamk.Signal.Error." which is omitted here for better readability.

Phone numbers always have the format +<countrycode><regional number>

== Methods

updateGroup(groupId<ay>, newName<s>, members<as>, avatar<s>) -> groupId<ay>::
* groupId  : Byte array representing the internal group identifier
* newName  : New name of group (empty if unchanged)
* members  : String array of new members to be invited to group
* avatar   : Filename of avatar picture to be set for group (empty if none)

Exceptions: AttachmentInvalid, Failure, InvalidNumber, GroupNotFound

updateProfile(newName<s>, about <s>, aboutEmoji <s>, avatar<s>, remove<b>) -> <>::
* newName     : New name for your own profile (empty if unchanged)
* about       : About message for profile (empty if unchanged)
* aboutEmoji  : Emoji for profile (empty if unchanged)
* avatar      : Filename of avatar picture for profile (empty if unchanged)
* remove      : Set to 1 if the existing avatar picture should be removed

Exceptions: Failure

setContactBlocked(number<s>, block<b>) -> <>::
* number  : Phone number affected by method
* block   : 0=remove block , 1=blocked

Messages from blocked numbers will no longer be forwarded via DBus.

Exceptions: InvalidNumber

setGroupBlocked(groupId<ay>, block<b>) -> <>::
* groupId : Byte array representing the internal group identifier
* block   : 0=remove block , 1=blocked

Messages from blocked groups will no longer be forwarded via DBus.

Exceptions: GroupNotFound

joinGroup(inviteURI<s>) -> <>::
* inviteURI : String starting with https://signal.group which is generated when you share a group link via Signal App

Exceptions: Failure

quitGroup(groupId<ay>) -> <>::
* groupId : Byte array representing the internal group identifier

Note that quitting a group will not remove the group from the getGroupIds command, but set it inactive which can be tested with isMember()

Exceptions: GroupNotFound, Failure

isMember(groupId<ay>) -> active<b>::
* groupId : Byte array representing the internal group identifier

Note that this method does not raise an Exception for a non-existing/unknown group but will simply return 0 (false)

* recipients : Array of phone numbers 

Exceptions: Failure, InvalidNumber, UntrustedIdentity

sendGroupMessage(message<s>, attachments<as>, groupId<ay>) -> timestamp<x>::

* attachments : String array of filenames to send as attachments (passed as filename, so need to be readable by the user signal-cli is running under)
* groupId     : Byte array representing the internal group identifier
* timestamp   : Can be used to identify the corresponding signal reply

Exceptions: GroupNotFound, Failure, AttachmentInvalid

sendNoteToSelfMessage(message<s>, attachments<as>) -> timestamp<x>::
* message     : Text to send (can be UTF8)
* attachments : String array of filenames to send as attachments (passed as filename, so need to be readable by the user signal-cli is running under)

* recipient   : Phone number of a single recipient
* recipients  : Array of phone numbers 
* timestamp   : Can be used to identify the corresponding signal reply

Depending on the type of the recipient field this sends a message to one or multiple recipients.

Exceptions: AttachmentInvalid, Failure, InvalidNumber, UntrustedIdentity

Depending on the type of the recipient(s) field this sends a reaction to one or multiple recipients.

Exceptions: Failure, InvalidNumber

sendGroupRemoteDeleteMessage(targetSentTimestamp<x>, groupId<ay>) -> timestamp<x>::
* targetSentTimestamp : Long representing timestamp of the message to delete
* groupId             : Byte array with base64 encoded group identifier

groupId   : Byte array representing the internal group identifier

Exceptions: None, if the group name is not found an empty string is returned

getGroupMembers(groupId<ay>) -> members<as>::

groupId   : Byte array representing the internal group identifier

Exceptions: None, if the group name is not found an empty array is returned

listNumbers() -> numbers<as>::

This is a concatenated list of all defined contacts as well of profiles known (e.g. peer group members or sender of received messages)

getContactNumber(name<s>) -> numbers<as>::
* numbers : Array of phone number

* result : Currently always returns 1=true

== Signals

SyncMessageReceived (timestamp<x>, sender<s>, destination<s>, groupId<ay>, message<s>, mentions<a(sii)>, attachments<as>)::
The sync message is received when the user sends a message from a linked device.

ReceiptReceived (timestamp<x>, sender<s>)::
* timestamp : Integer value that can be used to associate this e.g. with a sendMessage()
* sender    : Phone number of the sender

This signal is sent by each recipient (e.g. each group member) after the message was successfully delivered to the device

MessageReceived(timestamp<x>, sender<s>, groupId<ay>, message<s>, mentions<a(sii)>, attachments<as>)::
* timestamp   : Integer value that is used by the system to send a ReceiptReceived reply
* sender      : Phone number of the sender
* groupId     : Byte array representing the internal group identifier (empty when private message)
* message     : Message text
* mentions    : Struct array of mentions. A mention consists of a user name, its position in the message string and its length.
* attachments : String array of filenames for the attachments. These files are located in the signal-cli storage and the current user needs to have read access there

This signal is received whenever we get a private message or a message is posted in a group we are an active member

== Examples

Send a text message (without attachment) to a contact::
dbus-send --print-reply --type=method_call --dest="org.asamk.Signal" /org/asamk/Signal org.asamk.Signal.sendMessage string:"Message text goes here" array:string: string:+123456789

Send a group message::
dbus-send --session --print-reply --type=method_call --dest=org.asamk.Signal /org/asamk/Signal org.asamk.Signal.sendGroupMessage  string:'The message goes here'  array:string:'/path/to/attachmnt1','/path/to/attachmnt2'  array:byte:139,22,72,247,116,32,170,104,205,164,207,21,248,77,185

Print the group name corresponding to a groupId; the daemon runs on system bus, and was started without an explicit `-u USERNAME`::
dbus-send --system --print-reply --type=method_call --dest='org.asamk.Signal' /org/asamk/Signal/_1234567890 org.asamk.Signal.getGroupName array:byte:139,22,72,247,116,32,170,104,205,164,207,21,248,77,185
