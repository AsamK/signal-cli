:doctype: manpage

== Name

signal-cli-jsonrpc - A commandline and dbus interface for the Signal messenger

== Synopsis

*signal-cli* [--verbose] [--config CONFIG] [-a ACCOUNT] daemon [--socket] [--tcp] [--http]

*signal-cli* [--verbose] [--config CONFIG] [-a ACCOUNT] jsonRpc

== Description

See signal-cli (1) for details on the application.

signal-cli provides a JSON-RPC based API with the `jsonRpc` and `daemon` commands.

- `jsonRpc` command accepts input on STDIN and responds on STDOUT.
This is intended to make it easier to embed signal-cli in other applications.

  `signal-cli -a _ACCOUNT_ jsonRpc` or for multi-account mode `signal-cli jsonRpc`

- `daemon` command provides a UNIX, TCP socket or HTTP endpoint and can handle requests from multiple clients.

  `signal-cli -a _ACCOUNT_ daemon --socket` or for multi-account mode `signal-cli daemon --socket`

== Basic usage

In JSON-RPC mode, signal-cli will read requests from stdin.
Every request must be a JSON object in a single line.
Requests must have a unique "id" value to be able to match the response to the corresponding request.

Example:

REQUEST: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"listGroups","id":"my special mark"}`

RESPONSE: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":[{"id":"Pmpi+EfPWmsxiomLe9Nx2XF9HOE483p6iKiFj65iMwI=","name":"My Group","description":"It's special because it is mine.","isMember":true,"isBlocked":false,"members":["+33123456789","+440123456789"],"pendingMembers":[],"requestingMembers":[],"admins":["+33123456789","+440123456789"],"groupInviteLink":"https://signal.group/#CjQKIAtcbUw482i7bqvmJCwdgvg0FMif52N5v9lGg_bE4U3zEhCjHKSaPzWImMpnCbU8A1r0"}],"id":"my special mark"}`

From the command line:

`echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"listGroups","id":"my special mark"}' | signal-cli -u +33123456789 jsonRpc`

Like in dbus daemon mode, messages are automatically received in jsonRpc mode (`--receive-mode=on-start`).
Incoming messages are sent as JSON-RPC notifications.

Example:

`{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"receive","params":{"envelope":{"source":"+33123456789","sourceNumber":"+33123456789","sourceUuid":"uuid","sourceName":"name","sourceDevice":1,"timestamp":1631458508784,"dataMessage":{"timestamp":1631458508784,"message":"foobar","expiresInSeconds":0,"viewOnce":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"contacts":[]}}}}`

In order to not miss messages, automatic receiving of messages can be disabled with the `--receive-mode=manual` parameter.

REQUEST: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"id","method":"subscribeReceive"}`

RESPONSE: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":0,"id":"id"}`

Messages are then sent similar to the automatic mode, but wrapped in a subscription response object:

`{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"receive","params":{"subscription":0,"result":{"envelope":{"source":"+33123456789","sourceNumber":"+33123456789","sourceUuid":"uuid","sourceName":"name","sourceDevice":2,"timestamp":1693064367769,"syncMessage":{"sentMessage":{"destination":"+33123456789","destinationNumber":"+33123456789","destinationUuid":"uuid","timestamp":1693064367769,"message":"j","expiresInSeconds":0,"viewOnce":false}}},"account":"+33123456789"}}}`

=== Multi-account mode

When the daemon/jsonRpc command is started without an account parameter (-a), signal-cli will provide all local accounts and additional commands to register (`register`) and link (`startLink`, `finishLink`) new accounts.

In multi-account mode, requests for a single account require an additional `account` param.

REQUEST: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"listGroups","id":"my special mark","params":{"account":"+33123456789"}}`

== Commands

The commands available for the JSON-RPC mode are the same as the cli commands (except `register`, `verify` and `link`).
The `method` field is the command name and the parameters can be sent as the `params` object.

- Parameter names are provided in camelCase format instead of the hyphen format on the cli.

  e.g.: `--group-id=ID` on the cli becomes `"groupId":"ID"`

- Parameters that can take multiple values on the command line can be provided as single json value or as json array

  e.g. `--attachment ATTACH1 ATTACH2` becomes `"attachments":["ATTACH1", "ATTACH2"]`

  `--attachment ATTACH` becomes `"attachment":"ATTACH"`

=== Additional JSON-RPC commands

==== subscribeReceive

For receiving message with `--receive-mode=manual` parameter.

Tells the daemon to start receiving messages, returns the subscription id as a single integer value in the result.

==== unsubscribeReceive

Stop a previous subscription for receiving messages.

Params:

- `subscription`: the subscription id returned by `subscribeReceive`

==== startLink

Starts the provisioning for a new linked account.
Responds with a URI that can be used with the `addDevice` signal-cli command or encoded as a QR-code and scanned with a mobile phone.
The URI is only valid for a short amount of time.

REQUEST: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"startLink","id":"5"}`

RESPONSE: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"deviceLinkUri":"sgnl://linkdevice?uuid=X&pub_key=X"},"id":"5"}`

==== finishLink

Finish provisioning of a new linked account.
Can be called immediately after `startLink`, it will wait for a response from the primary device.

Params:

- `deviceLinkUri`: the URI returned by `startLink`
- `deviceName`: (optional) the name for the new linked device

REQUEST: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"finishLink","id":"6","params":{"deviceLinkUri":"sgnl://linkdevice?uuid=X&pub_key=X","deviceName":"new-name"}}`

RESPONSE: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"deviceLinkUri":"sgnl://linkdevice?uuid=X&pub_key=X"},"id":"6"}`

== Examples

REQUEST: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"listGroups","id":"5"}`

RESPONSE: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":[...],"id":"5"}`

REQUEST: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"send","params":{"recipient":["+YYY"],"message":"MESSAGE"},"id":4}`

RESPONSE: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"timestamp":999},"id":4}`

REQUEST: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"updateGroup","params":{"groupId":"GROUP_ID=","name":"new group name","members":["+ZZZ"],"link":"enabledWithApproval","setPermissionEditDetails":"only-admins"},"id":"someId"}`

RESPONSE: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"timestamp":9999},"id":"someId"}`

REQUEST: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"sendSyncRequest","id":9}`

RESPONSE: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{},"id":9}`

REQUEST: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0"}`

RESPONSE: `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":-32600,"message":"method field must be set","data":null},"id":null}`

=== Python examples

==== HTTP

Let's suppose, the daemon was started like that: `signal-cli -a ACCOUNT daemon --http 'localhost:8000'`

Then minimal example to interact with it will be:
```python
import requests
import random

# 'id' must be or you'll get '201' answer
x = {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "listGroups", "id": random.randint(1, 999)}

# '/api/v1/rpc' is a undocumented but obligatory part of path to API
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/v1/rpc", json=x)
response.json()
```

==== Websockets

I failed to achieve any kind of responce with `websockets`

==== TCP

I failed to achieve any kind of responce with `socket` and connection always brakes with `zmq`
